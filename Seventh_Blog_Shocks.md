# COVID-19 Variables and Polls
## Oct 23, 2020

COVID-19 has been a permanent fixture in the news and everpresent in the minds of many people today, given its impact on people's work and daily life. Given such prevalence, this begs the question: how will COVID-related variables affect the 2020 election? I will explore this topic by first noting the trends for three COVID variables, i.e., the increase in cases, the increase in deaths, and the increase in test results per day relative to their respective totals. Then, I will display the relationship between these variables and the average poll support for each candidate, which will provide insight into how such variables might impact each candidate's popular vote shares (link week 3 when I talk about this later on).

**COVID-19 Trends in the United States**

The graphs above demonstrate trends for COVID-19 related variables like the increase in deaths, cases, and test results in the United States from late January to October 2020. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **General decrease in COVID-19 related daily deaths.** From the data available, the daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 has generally decreased from its peak in late April. Such can be attributed to many factors, including a better understanding of the virus, better treatment available, etc.  

* **General increase in COVID-19 related daily cases and test results.** From the data available, the daily cases and test results attributed to COVID-19 has generally increased since late January. However, daily test results have increased consistently, while daily cases peaked around mid-July, fell drastically, and have experienced a significant resurgence since September. 

**Relationship between COVID-19 Variables and 2020 Candidates' Average Support**

**The relationship between daily COVID-19 deaths and 2020 candidates' average poll support.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Biden's and Trump's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. However, the relationship between the afromentioned variables is stronger for Biden than Trump. Such is evident given the r-squared values for the linear regressions between the two variables for each candidate; the r-squared values between such variables are 0.49 and 0.14 for Biden and Trump, respectively. This is noteworthy, given one would expect a stronger negative relationship between the daily increase of COVID-19 deaths and an incumbent candidate's average poll support relative to the non-incumbent's.

**The relationship between daily COVID-19 cases and 2020 candidates' average poll support.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Trump's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 cases in the United States. However, there appears to be little to no relationship between Biden's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 cases. Such is further evidenced by the r-squared value for the linear regression between the two variables for each candidate, which is 0.61 for Trump and only 0.02 for Biden. This is distinct from the previous relationship between the increase of COVID-19 deaths and Trump's average poll support, which could be attributed to the higher salience of increasing COVID-19 cases in the media and the relation such has to the incumbent candidate.

**The relationship between daily COVID-19 test results and 2020 candidates' average poll support.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Trump's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results in the United States. However, there appears to be little to no relationship between Biden's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results. This is also evidenced by the r-squared value for the linear regression between the two variables for each candidate, which is 0.46 for Trump and 0.01 for Biden. However, one should note any relationship between a candidate's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results is likely confounded by the fact that COVID-19 test results have increased consistently over time; thus, relationships between a candidate's average support and daily increase of COVID-19 test results could be reflective of a candidate's average support trends over time.

**Implications for 2020 and Takeaways**

Ultimatley, the previous relationships indicate 
trump strong negative relationship with covid case increases could mean a spike in cases would not bode well for the canddiate 
difficult to tell how excatly the shock will affect election, but if our data is anything to go off of, most likely in the form of decreasing incumbent vote share, given strong relatnionshopp between polls and vote share observed in previous blogs (blog 3). However, hard to tell based on such situation being unique. 
Hopefully, data from this election will provide creater insight innto how some of these shocks, like a pandemic, can affect incumbent vote shares and generally how unexpected shocks can affect candidates .
