# COVID-19 Variables and Polls
## Oct 23, 2020

COVID-19 is an everpresent news fixture that has swept the nation and is in the mind of many people today, given changes to their work and day-to-day life based on such virus. Given its prevalence in the news and the general population, this begs the question: how will COVID-related variables affect the 2020 election? I will explore this topic by first noting the trends for three COVID variables, i.e., the increase in cases, the increase in deaths, and the increase in test results. Then, I will display the relationship between these variables and the average support in each candidate's polls, which will provide some insight into how such variables will impact each candidate's popular vote shares (link week 3 when I talk about this later on).

The graphs above demonstrate trends for COVID-19 related variables like the increase in deaths, cases, and test results in the United States from late January to October 2020. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **General decrease in COVID-19 related daily deaths.** From the data available, the daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 has generally decreased from its peak in late April. Such can be attributed to many factors, including a better understanding of the virus, better treatment available, etc.  

* **General increase in COVID-19 related daily cases and test results.** From the data available, the daily cases and test results attributed to COVID-19 has generally increased since late January. However, daily test results have increased consistently, while daily cases peaked around mid-July, fell drastically, and have experienced a significant resurgence since September.
