# COVID-19 Variables and Polls
## Oct 23, 2020

COVID-19 has been a permanent fixture in the news and everpresent in the minds of many people today, given its impact on people's work and daily life. Given such prevalence, this begs the question: how will COVID-related variables affect the 2020 election? I will explore this topic by first noting the trends for three COVID variables, i.e., the increase in cases, the increase in deaths, and the increase in test results per day relative to their respective totals. Then, I will display the relationship between these variables and the average poll support for each candidate, which will provide insight into how such variables might impact each candidate's popular vote shares. 

**COVID-19 Trends in the United States**

The graphs above demonstrate trends for COVID-19 related variables like the increase in deaths, cases, and test results in the United States from late January to October 2020. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **A general decrease in COVID-19 related daily deaths.** From the data available, the daily deaths attributed to COVID-19 has generally decreased from its peak in late April. Such can be attributed to many factors, including a better understanding of the virus, better treatment available, etc.  

* **A general increase in COVID-19 related daily cases and test results.** From the data available, the daily cases and test results attributed to COVID-19 have generally increased since late January. However, daily cases peaked around mid-July, fell drastically, and have experienced a significant resurgence since September, while daily test results have increased consistently. 

**The Relationship between the 2020 Candidates' Average Support and COVID-19 Variables**

**The relationship between the 2020 candidates' average poll support and daily COVID-19 deaths.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Biden's and Trump's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. However, the relationship between the afromentioned variables is stronger for Biden than Trump. Such is evident given the r-squared values for the linear regressions between the two variables are 0.49 and 0.14 for Biden and Trump, respectively. This is noteworthy, given one would expect a stronger negative relationship between the daily increase of COVID-19 deaths and an incumbent candidate's average poll support relative to the non-incumbent.

**The relationship between 2020 candidates' average poll support and daily increase of COVID-19 cases.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Trump's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 cases. However, there appears to be little to no relationship between Biden's average support and the increase of COVID-19 cases. Such is further evidenced by the r-squared values for the linear regressions between the two variables, which is 0.61 for Trump and only 0.02 for Biden. This is distinct from the previous relationship between Trump's average poll support and the increase of COVID-19 deaths, which could be attributed to the higher salience of increasing COVID-19 cases in the media and the relation such has to the incumbent candidate.

**The relationship between 2020 candidates' average poll support and daily COVID-19 test results.** The aforementioned graphs demonstrate the generally negative relationship between Trump's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results. However, there appears to be little to no relationship between Biden's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results. This is also evidenced by the r-squared value for the linear regression between the two variables for each candidate, which is 0.46 for Trump and 0.01 for Biden. However, one should note any relationship between a candidate's average support in the polls and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results is likely confounded by the fact that COVID-19 test results have increased consistently over time; thus, a relationship between a candidate's average support and the daily increase of COVID-19 test results could merely be reflective of a candidate's average support trends over time.

**Implications for 2020 and Takeaways**

Ultimately, the previous relationships indicate that COVID-19 will likely negatively affect the incumbent candidate's vote share. Given the strong relationship between a candidate’s average support and their vote share I observed in [previous blogs](Third_Blog_Polls.md), the strong negative relationship between Trump’s average support and the increase in COVID-19 cases suggests a similar strong relationship exists between Trump’s 2020 vote share and the increase in COVID-19 cases. This is especially pertinent, given I have also demonstrated how daily COVID-19 cases are on the rise. 

On the other hand, COVID-19 will likely not affect the challenger’s vote share. This is due to the weak relationship evident between Biden’s average support and most of the COVID-19 variables I observed. Moreover, the negative relationship between Biden’s average support and the increase in COVID-19 deaths will likely play a small role in the election, given the downward trend of COVID-19 daily deaths. 

Overall, my blog provided insight into the trends and relationships between COVID-19 variables and a candidate’s average support, as well as how such variables might impact a candidate’s vote share. Hopefully, data from the 2020 election will provide further insight on how shocks, like a pandemic, can influence a candidate’s vote share and future elections.
