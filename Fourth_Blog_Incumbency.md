# The Incumbency Advantage and Time For Change Model
## Oct 2, 2020

It is common knowledge in the political science space that incumbents tend to perform better than non-incumbents in elections. In fact, since 1932, only three presidents have failed their re-election bids. But such begs the question, how does this incumbency advantage affect election predictions? In this blog, I will explore this question, first by analyzing the historical popular vote share of incumbent candidates vs. non-incumbents. Then, I will highlight how the incumbency advantage is factored into models like the "time-for-change" model. Finally, I will compare the time-for-change model to model's from previous weeks and evaluate such on their in-sample fit and out-of-sample error. 

**The Relationship between a Candidate's Incumbency Status and Two-Party Popular Vote Share**

To understand how incumbency status can affect election predictions, it is necessary first to understand the relationship between a candidate's incumbency status and two-party popular vote share. The boxplots above display historical trends for such, stratifying candidates based on their incumbency status and displaying each set of candidates' two-party popular vote shares from 1948 to 2016. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **A higher median vote share for incumbents.** The boxplots indicate that an incumbent candidate's two-party vote share has historically been higher than a non-incumbent candidiates' two-party popular vote share. This is evident given the greater median two-party vote share for incumbent candidates relative to non-incumbent candidates, which fits in with the commonly held notion that incumbets perform better than non-incumbets. 

* **Smaller spread for non-incumbets.** The graphic also illustrates how the relationship between a candidate's average support and popular vote share is stronger for incumbent party candidates than non-incumbent party candidates. Such can be seen by the data points in the incumbent party graph falling closer to a one-for-one diagonal line between the x-axis and y-axis than the non-incumbent party graph.



in other words, a majority of the data points for non-incumbets lie below the 50 percent line, while the majority of data points for incumbents lie above the 50 percent line
