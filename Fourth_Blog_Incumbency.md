# The Incumbency Advantage and Time For Change Model
## Oct 2, 2020

It is common knowledge in the political science space that incumbents tend to perform better than non-incumbents in elections. In fact, since 1932, only three presidents have failed in their re-election bids. But this begs the question, how does this incumbency advantage affect electoral predictions? In this blog, I will explore this question, first by analyzing the historical popular vote share of incumbent candidates vs non incumbents. Then, I will highlight how the incumbency advantage is factored into models like the "time-for-change" model. Finally, I will compare the time-for-change model to model's from previous weeks and evaluate such on their in-sample fit and out-of-sample error.
