# The Incumbency Advantage and Time For Change Model
## Oct 2, 2020

Incumbents have a historically good record, common held beleif that they do better. Winning 9/14 elections since 1960 (look up how many times incumbents win), they seem to fare far better than their non-incumbent counterparts. But is this advantage trully impactful in elections? In this blog, we will explore such dynamic, first analyzing the historical popular vote share of incumbent candidates vs non incumbents, then analyzing how the incumbency advantage is used in models like the Time for change model, and finally comparing the time for change model to previous models (i.e avg support).
