# The Incumbency Advantage and Time For Change Model
## Oct 2, 2020

It is common knowledge in the political science space that incumbents tend to perform better than non-incumbents in elections. In fact, since 1932, only three presidents have failed their re-election bids. But such begs the question, how does this incumbency advantage affect election predictions? In this blog, I will explore this question, first by analyzing the historical popular vote share of incumbent candidates vs. non-incumbents. Then, I will highlight how the incumbency advantage is factored into models like the "time-for-change" model. Finally, I will compare the time-for-change model to model's from previous weeks and evaluate such on their in-sample fit and out-of-sample error. 

**The Relationship between a Candidate's Incumbency Status and Two-Party Popular Vote Share**

To understand how incumbency status can affect election predictions, it is necessary first to understand the relationship between a candidate's incumbency status and two-party popular vote share. The boxplots above display historical trends for such, stratifying candidates based on their incumbency status and displaying each set of candidates' two-party popular vote shares from 1948 to 2016. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **A higher median vote share for incumbents.** The graphs indicate that a candidate's average support in the polls has historically been highly related to their respective popular vote share. This is evident based on the mostly linear and relatively narrow spread of the data points for both graphs.

* **Higher incumbent accuracy.** The graphic also illustrates how the relationship between a candidate's average support and popular vote share is stronger for incumbent party candidates than non-incumbent party candidates. Such can be seen by the data points in the incumbent party graph falling closer to a one-for-one diagonal line between the x-axis and y-axis than the non-incumbent party graph.


This fits in with the commonly held notion that incumbets perform better than non-incumbets,
