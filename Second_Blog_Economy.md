# The Economy and Popular Vote
## Sept 18, 2020

"It's the economy, stupid." Such were the famous words uttered by James Carville, Bill Clinton's campaign strategist, in 1992 towards campaign workers as one of the three messages they should focus on. This phrase perhaps best encapsulates the basic understanding most people have of the role the economy plays in deciding elections. But how strong is the relationship between the economy and a candidate's vote share, what is its scope, and can the economy really help us predict elections? Recent literature has offered some insight into these questions, with Healy and Lenz finding that voters primarily respond to the election year economy instead of longer-term economic figures. In turn, this blog will seek to understand how the economy can predict elections by first analyzing the relationship between Q2 election-year economic variables and vote shares, fitting models between these economic variables and vote share, and ultimately using the model with the greatest predictive power to predict the 2020 election.
