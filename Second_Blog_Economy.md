# The Economy and Popular Vote
## Sept 18, 2020

"It's the economy, stupid." Such were the famous lines uttered by James Carville, Bill Clinton's campagin strategist, at campaign workers in 1992. This phrase perhaps best encapsulates the standard political science understanding that the economy plays some role in deciding elections. 

but how real is this relationship, and can it help us predict election? 

recent literature has suggested while overall economic factrs might offer some insight into elections, econmic data from presidential election years could be especially predictive. 
Thus, this blog will seek to understand how economy can predict election by first analyzing the relationship between Q2 econonmic variables and vote share, fitting models between economic variables and voteshare and evaluating their fit, and ultimatley using the "best" model to give a 2020 prediction.
