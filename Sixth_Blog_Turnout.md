# Turnout in Popular Vote Predictions
## Oct 15, 2020

General stuff about turnout. 
But how can turnout help predict popular vote shares for candidates? In this blog, I will seek to answer questions. I will first consider trends in turnout as a percentage for the voting-eligible population, both for the presidential and midterm elections. I will then incorporate this turnout variable in a linear regression model, stratified by party affiliation, and compare it to models from previous weeks. Finally, I will use the new model to predict the 2020 election, considering several turnout scenarios. 

**Turnout Trends in the United States**

United States Presidential Election-Year Turnout (1980-2016)  |  United States Midterm-Year Turnout (1982-2014)

This data demonstrates trends in turnout from the years of X to Y for United States general elections. Turnout here is calcualted as a percentage of voting-eligible-population. The major takeaways include: 

*look up if turnout data is for presidential elections

* **Increasing turnout during presidential election years.** Make sure this is only for US elections

* **Decreasing turnout during midterm election years.** Make sure this is only for midterms. Also awknoledge that 2018 would be much higher.
