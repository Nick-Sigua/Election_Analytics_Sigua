# Turnout in Popular Vote Predictions
## Oct 15, 2020

Campaigns have employed many strategies to mobilize their base and increase voter turnout throughout past presidential elections (source?). This begs the question: how can turnout help predict a candidate's popular vote share? In this blog, I will seek to answer such a question. I will first consider trends in turnout as a percentage for the voting-eligible population for the presidential and midterm elections. I will then incorporate this turnout variable in a linear regression model, stratified by party affiliation, and compare it to models from previous weeks. Finally, I will use this new model to predict the 2020 election, considering several turnout scenarios.

**Turnout Trends in the United States**

The graphs above demonstrate trends in the turnout rate (as a percentage of the voting-eligible-population) for United States elections from 1980 to 2016. Some of the major takeaways include: 

* **Increasing turnout for presidential elections.** this shows turnout for US presidential elections from 1980 to 2016

* **Decreasing turnout for midterm elections.** Make sure this is only for midterms. Also awknoledge that 2018 would be much higher.
