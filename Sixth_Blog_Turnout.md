# Turnout in Popular Vote Predictions
## Oct 15, 2020

General stuff about turnout. 
But how can turnout help predict popular vote shares for candidates? In this blog, I will seek to answer questions. I will first consider trends in turnout as a percentage for the voting-eligible population, both for the presidential and midterm elections. I will then incorporate this turnout variable in a linear regression model, stratified by party affiliation, and compare it to models from previous weeks. Finally, I will use the new model to predict the 2020 election, considering several turnout scenarios.
