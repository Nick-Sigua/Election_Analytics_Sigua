# Turnout in Popular Vote Predictions
## Oct 15, 2020

But how can turnout help predict popular vote shares for candidates? In this blog, I will seek to answer question. I will first consider trends in turnout as a percentage for the voting eligible population, both for presidential eleciton years and midterm years. I will then incorporate this turnout variable in a linear regression model, stratified by party affiliation, and compare this model to models from previous weeks. Finally, I will use the new model to predict the 2020 election, considering a number of turnout scenarios.
