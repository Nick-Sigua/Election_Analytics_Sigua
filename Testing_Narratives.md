# Testing Narratives  
## December 1, 2020

In this blog, I will seek to provide a comprehensive reflection of my final prediction model. I will do this by first recapping the average support model and its main predictions. Then, I will detail its inaccuracies and explicitly highlight the states such inaccuracies were most prevalent. In turn, I will propose two hypotheses for why my model was inaccurate at times and suggest quantitative tests that could test these hypotheses' validity. Ultimatley, I will end by noting how I might change my model if I were to do it again. 

**The Pandemic Narrative**

Summarize the narrative you are choosing to investigate and briefly explain why the narrative might be important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester.

What is the narrative - pandemic hurt trump's chances at re-election. (use articles, say why it makes sense) 
Why it is important to test -> falls in line with shocks we have observered, but also slightly unique case, given unlike a clinton shock, effects prolonged over camapign, not just effect one day. played a role throughout camapign cycle, and important to test also as it could begin to give insight into how pandemic could affect us in the future (this is important to say given how i will test implication, as implication means it can increase or decrease in prevalance).
moreover, some covid 19 variables, like deaths, have actually been found to have strong trump support, so narrative is not as obvious as it might seen, at least empricially. 

**Tests**

In a perfect world.... given ideal test
then say can't do this, so have to go with other tests
for one.... 
data, method
justify
also....
data, method
justify
aknlowledge limitations, can't test causaility, but can provide preliminary evidence 

**Results**
