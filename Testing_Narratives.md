# Testing Narratives  
## December 1, 2020

In this blog, I will seek to provide an initial analysis of the evidence surrounding a post-election narrative. I will do this by first summarizing the narrative and explaining why it is important to test such. Then I will explain the testable implications of this narrative and how I could use these implications to derive a method of testing the narrative. Finally, I will describe the afromentioned test results and explain whether they might provide preliminary evidence for the narrative I am focusing on. 

**The Pandemic Narrative**

Summarize the narrative you are choosing to investigate and briefly explain why the narrative might be important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester.



What is the narrative - pandemic hurt trump's chances at re-election. (use articles, say why it makes sense) 
Why it is important to test -> falls in line with shocks we have observered, but also slightly unique case, given unlike a clinton shock, effects prolonged over camapign, not just effect one day. played a role throughout camapign cycle, and important to test also as it could begin to give insight into how pandemic could affect us in the future (this is important to say given how i will test implication, as implication means it can increase or decrease in prevalance).
moreover, some covid 19 variables, like deaths, have actually been found to have strong trump support, so narrative is not as obvious as it might seen, at least empricially. 

**Tests**

In a perfect world.... given ideal test
then say can't do this, so have to go with other tests
for one.... 
data, method (make sure to really explain data and correlation, as soubhik was confused last time). 
justify (especially why national rather than state by state).
also....
data, method
justify
aknlowledge limitations, can't test causaility, but can provide preliminary evidence 

**Results**
