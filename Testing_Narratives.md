# Testing Narratives  
## December 1, 2020

In this blog, I will seek to provide an initial analysis of the evidence surrounding a post-election narrative. I will do this by first summarizing the narrative and explaining why it is important to test such. Then I will explain the testable implications of this narrative and how I could use these implications to derive a method of testing the narrative. Finally, I will describe the afromentioned test results and explain whether they might provide preliminary evidence for the narrative I am focusing on. 

**The Pandemic Narrative**

Summarize the narrative you are choosing to investigate and briefly explain why the narrative might be important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester.

The main post-election narrative I will investigate is the notion that the coronavirus pandemic negativley impacted Trump's bid for re-election. Various media outlets, like the Times and the Washington Post, formed this narrative by touting that the occurance of such pandemic and all its associated issues dragged Trump's prospects for winning the election down and was a factor in his loss (https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/), https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/trump-pandemic-coronavirus-election/). Pundits, like Sarah Longwell, founder of the Republican Voters Against Trump, similarly reflected this sentiment and pointed towards the occurance of the pandemic as a inhibiting factor on Trump's electoral efforts (https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/). The notion largely builds off the major pre-election narrative, which similarly touted that the pandemic would hurt Trump's chances; given the election results, one could logically see how many would feel vindicated in such assumption. 




 the major pre-election narrative of the same nature, which was seemingly validated based on the results of the actual election. 



after election, these sentiments seemed validated. for instance, times help coronovirus as negativley impactful, with the occurance of such pandemic and all its associeted issues). washington post similarly. and leader of republican thing also pushed such forth. 

maybe just sneak in the fact that talking about in generally, rather than deaths or unemployment 




What is the narrative - pandemic hurt trump's chances at re-election. (use articles, say why it makes sense) 
Why it is important to test -> falls in line with shocks we have observered, but also slightly unique case, given unlike a clinton shock, effects prolonged over camapign, not just effect one day. played a role throughout camapign cycle, and important to test also as it could begin to give insight into how pandemic could affect us in the future (this is important to say given how i will test implication, as implication means it can increase or decrease in prevalance).
moreover, some covid 19 variables, like deaths, have actually been found to have strong trump support, so narrative is not as obvious as it might seen, at least empricially. 

**Tests**

In a perfect world.... given ideal test
then say can't do this, so have to go with other tests
for one.... 
data, method (make sure to really explain data and correlation, as soubhik was confused last time). 
justify (especially why national rather than state by state).
also....
data, method
justify
aknlowledge limitations, can't test causaility, but can provide preliminary evidence 

**Results**
