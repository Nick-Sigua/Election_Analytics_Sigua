# Testing Narratives  
## December 1, 2020

In this blog, I will seek to provide an initial analysis of the evidence surrounding a post-election narrative. I will do this by first summarizing the narrative and explaining why it is important to test such. Then I will explain the testable implications of this narrative and how I could use these implications to derive a method of testing the narrative. Finally, I will describe the afromentioned test results and explain whether they might provide preliminary evidence for the narrative I am focusing on. 

**The Pandemic Narrative**

The main post-election narrative I will investigate is the notion that the coronavirus pandemic negatively impacted Trump's bid for re-election. Various media outlets, like the [Times](https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/trump-pandemic-coronavirus-election/), contributed this narrative by touting that the occurrence of such pandemic and all its associated issues dragged Trump's prospects for winning the election down and was a factor in his loss. Pundits, like [Sarah Longwell](https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/), founder of the Republican Voters Against Trump, similarly reflected this sentiment and pointed towards the occurrence of the pandemic as an inhibiting factor on Trump's electoral efforts. The narrative largely builds off the major [pre-election day pandemic narrative](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/politics/coronavirus-trump-analysis/index.html) of the same vein, which was seemingly validated based on the election results.

This narrative is important to test for several reasons. For one, the narrative is based on a unique shock to the 2020 race. Given we have discussed shocks, among other variables, in our analysis of elections throughout this semester, testing how a prolonged shock like a pandemic could impact an incumbent candidate is a natural extension of what we have analyzed in class and would provide valuable insight into how such might affect future elections. Another reason why the narrative is important to test is that the pandemic has influenced some of the variables we have analyzed over the semester, like the economy. Thus, a test of such a narrative could provide a fuller understanding of all the dynamics of the 2020 election and a variable that has affected other election-variables we have incorporated in past models. 

**Tests**

Ideally, the best test of the afromentioned pandemic narrative would be to compare Trump's actual popular vote share in an election where the pandemic occurred to Trump's popular vote share in a simultaneous and identical election where the pandemic did not happen; if Trump's vote share were lower in the election where the pandemic occurred, such would prove the pandemic had a negative impact on Trump's electoral prospects. In the absence of such an ideal test, there are a few testable implications I could analyze instead that could offer some preliminary evidence for the existence of the narrative. 

The main testable implication I will consider is whether there is a negative correlation between Trump's average support in the polls and the daily increase in Covid-19 cases. This implication is justifiable given, if the coronavirus pandemic negatively impacted Trump's bid for re-election, then the increasing prevalence of the virus, i.e., a rise in daily COVID-19 cases, would be negatively related to Trump's support in the polls (thus his chances at re-election). To derive this correlation, I collected data on the daily increase in national Covid-19 cases and Trump's average support in the polls from the middle of February to election day in November. This will allow me to plot the daily increase in Covid-19 cases and the corresponding average support for Trump across the duration of the pandemic. 


i necessarily focus on the national level rather than state or county, given

limitations of this? 


why this makes sense
data (data from dates, each point is covid-19 case increase on given day and trump's poll support on such day)
justfiy focus on national level "necessarily look at relationship nationally given data limitations" 


data, method (make sure to really explain data and correlation, as soubhik was confused last time). 
justify (especially why national rather than state by state).

also....
data, method
justify
aknlowledge limitations, can't test causaility, but can provide preliminary evidence 

**Results**
