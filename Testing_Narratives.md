# Testing Narratives  
## December 1, 2020

In this blog, I will seek to provide an initial analysis of the evidence surrounding a post-election narrative. I will do this by first summarizing the narrative and explaining why it is important to test such. Then I will explain the testable implications of this narrative and how I could use these implications to derive a method of testing the narrative. Finally, I will describe the afromentioned test results and explain whether they might provide preliminary evidence for the narrative I am focusing on. 

**The Pandemic Narrative**

Summarize the narrative you are choosing to investigate and briefly explain why the narrative might be important to test in the context of the various election-related variables we have discussed this semester.

The main post-election narrative I will investigate is the notion that the coronavirus pandemic negatively impacted Trump's bid for re-election. Various media outlets, like the [Times](https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/trump-pandemic-coronavirus-election/), formed this narrative by touting that the occurrence of such pandemic and all its associated issues dragged Trump's prospects for winning the election down and was a factor in his loss. Pundits, like [Sarah Longwell](https://time.com/5907973/donald-trump-loses-2020-election/), founder of the Republican Voters Against Trump, similarly reflected this sentiment and pointed towards the occurrence of the pandemic as an inhibiting factor on Trump's electoral efforts. The narrative largely builds off the major [pre-election day pandemic narrative](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/politics/coronavirus-trump-analysis/index.html) of the same vein, which was seemingly validated based on the election results.

This narrative is important to test for a number of reasons. For one, the narrative is based on a unique shock to the 2020 race. Given we have discussed shocks, among other variables, in our analysis of elections throughout this semester, building a better understanding of how a prolonged shock like a pandemic could impact the incumbent candidate would be a natural extension to what we have analyzed in class and provide valuable insight into how such might affect future elections. Another reason why the narrative is important to test is the 
pandemic has influenced some of the variables we have observed already, like economy. thus, testing the notion that the pandemic negativley impacted Trump's election chances could directly test the influence of a variable we have been indrectly testing and observing in our data so far, 
pandemic influences other variables, so important to directly test its effects as well. focus, not directly test, direct might be too strong. 


For another, likely had an influence in all things we studied this semester, like economy, turnout, etc. Rather than indirectly measure effects through these vehicles, testing impacts of covid could provide an opporuntity to directly test a variable that has influenced many of the election variables we have already studied. Lastly, narrative is not obvious as might seem initially, given preliminary studies, like NPR, demonstrate covid related variables negative impact <- might not include. 





What is the narrative - pandemic hurt trump's chances at re-election. (use articles, say why it makes sense) 
Why it is important to test -> falls in line with shocks we have observered, but also slightly unique case, given unlike a clinton shock, effects prolonged over camapign, not just effect one day. played a role throughout camapign cycle, and important to test also as it could begin to give insight into how pandemic could affect us in the future (this is important to say given how i will test implication, as implication means it can increase or decrease in prevalance).
moreover, some covid 19 variables, like deaths, have actually been found to have strong trump support, so narrative is not as obvious as it might seen, at least empricially. 

**Tests**

In a perfect world.... given ideal test
then say can't do this, so have to go with other tests
for one.... 
data, method (make sure to really explain data and correlation, as soubhik was confused last time). 
justify (especially why national rather than state by state).
also....
data, method
justify
aknlowledge limitations, can't test causaility, but can provide preliminary evidence 

**Results**
