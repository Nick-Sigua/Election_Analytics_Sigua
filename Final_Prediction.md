# Final Election Prediction
## Oct 29, 2020

Throughout this past semester, I have analyzed the impacts of variables such as GDP, incumbency status, and turnout on a presidential candidate's popular vote share. However, no single variable has been more related or more predictive of a candidate's populate vote share than a candidate's average support in the polls. Thus, my final prediction model will rely heavily on the relationship between a candidate's popular vote share and their average support in the polls. 





explain why you don't include other variables, like second quarter GDP: might confound results, sometimes make predicitons better but sometimes they don't.
