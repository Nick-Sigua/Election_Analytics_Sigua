# Polls in Popular Vote Predictions
## Sept 24, 2020

Polls have become a mainstay in the modern-day election. From the moment the primaries start to the moment elections end, the media coverage of a candidates' approval rating is non-stop. While such can be largely attributed to horse-race journalism, the emphasis on polls during the campaign season does beg the question as to how predictive polls are in presidential elections. We will consider this question first by analyzing the historical relationship between a candidate's average support in the polls and their subsequent popular vote share. Then, we will consider the variation in the poll quality present when considering a candidate's average support and construct a model for elections based on weighing poll quality. Finally, we will compare such model to previous and unweighted models, and use the model with the least error relative to the 2016 results to predict the 2020 election.
