# Polls in Popular Vote Predictions
## Sept 24, 2020

Polls have become a mainstay in the modern-day election. From the moment the primaries start to the moment elections end, the media coverage of a candidates' approval rating is non-stop. While such can be largely attributed to horse-race journalism, the emphasis on polls during the campaign season does beg the question as to how predictive polls are in presidential elections. We will consider this question first by analyzing the historical relationship between a candidate's average support in the polls and their subsequent popular vote share. Then, we will consider the variation in the pollster quality in recent elections and construct a predictive model based on weighing poll quality. Finally, we will compare such model to previous and unweighted models, and use the model with the least error relative to the 2016 results to predict the 2020 election.

**The Relationship between a Candidate's Average Poll Support and Popular Vote Share**

To understand how polls can predict election results, it is necessary to first understand the relationship between a candidate's average poll support and their popular vote share. The graphics above display historical trends for such, using aggregated measures of poll support for an incumbent or non-incumbent candidate six weeks before an election and said candidates' popular vote shares for such election from 1968 to 2016. Some of the major takeaways include:

* **A strong relationship.** The graphs indicate that a candidate's average support in the polls has historically been highly related to their respective popular vote shares. This is evident based on the generally linear and relativley narrow spread of the data points for both the incumbent and challenger graphs. 

* **Higher incumbent accuracy.**
