# The Electoral Vote
## Sept 12, 2020

The electoral college has been a staple in American elections since the country's first presidential race. However, it's deviation from the popular vote in recent elections and its apparent bias towards a single party have caused increased scrutiny on such a system. Thus, this blog will seek to evaluate these concerns by comparing trends between the electoral vote share and popular vote share, as well as analyzing key races in which the electoral vote has deviated from the popular vote.

In order to understand the recent controversy surrounding the electoral vote, it's important to first develop a firm understanding of the trends between the popular and electoral vote shares attained by the two major parties. These trends are plotted above, using popular and electoral vote data from the years 1948-2016. Some of the major takeaways include:  

* **Similar shape.** Although recent elections might influence most calls to action on the electoral vote, the 	electoral vote share attained by each candidate has followed a very similar shape to the popular vote. Both had blowout years, and have tightened in the past two decades. Aside from 2  discrpensies, which we will discuss in detail, one can claim the electoral vote share has closely followed the overall trends and figures of the popular vote share for the past couple of decades. 

* **Overstated win margins.** Although the electoral vote share tends to follow the same shape, one can immediately notice is tends to overstate the vote share attained. For example, in 1964, while X candidate won with X%, in the electoral vote, he attained Y% of the votes This is largely a product of winner take all system, with which all electoral votes are needed to the popular vote winner of a state. 

* **Winner discrepensies.** From the graph, the person with the higher popular vote share has been mostly the person with the higher electoral vote share, reaffirming the overall similarity between the two. But as alluded to previously, there are two years where this is not the case: 2000 and 2016. In these two elections, the winner of the popular vote share was not the winner of the electoral vote share, as evident in 2016 by the republicans beating the democrats electorally but not popularly, and less evident in 2000. Thus, further investigation is needed into these races.
