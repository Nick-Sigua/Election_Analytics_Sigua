The first half of the twentieth century experienced greater swings and greater margins of victory, while point spreads in the last 20 years have been less than 10 points. The 3 <u>closest</u> elections in the last 60 years and their "prevailing narratives" are:

* **2000, margin of `0.5%` or 500k votes or `5 EV` (Bush vs. Gore).** Gore managed to distance himself from Clinton's scandals (which put him neck-and-neck with Bush); though, really, this was anyone's election.
