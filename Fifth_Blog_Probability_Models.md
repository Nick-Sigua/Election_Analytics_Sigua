# Polls and Probabilistic Models
## Oct 9, 2020

In intro, set up how we will be using probabilistc models to analyze the 2020 race instead of linear regressions

commonly, i have used linear regressions in my blog to analyze pollls, the best single predictor of elections I have considered thus far. But such is subject to errors, as linear regressions can be less than zero, making the practicality of such results more tenous than one might initially think. This week, instead, we will explore the 2020 race through probabilistic models, hoping to uncover insight into the results in key swing states based on binomial polls. 

**The 2020 Map**

Map here

This map demonstrates the 2020 election win margin for biden in each state, based on average support. Although there is a lot of informaiton, there are a couple of discpeencies. The main takeaways are:

Biden favored. from the data availible, the probabilistc models favor biden. this falls in line with earlier weeks based on polls, given biden's current lead in the polls. The following translates to the probabilistic models for the united states. 

Missing data. the missing data makes it hard for such probabilistc map to give a sense of eleciton outcomes. many states dont have answers. moreover, limited data makes some state's win margins less than reasonable. Given this missing data, a different anlysis by focusing on the key swing states of the election is necessary, as opposed to considering the entire map. 

**Swing States 2020**

Given an analysis of the win margins for every state does not give that insightful of answers, given missing data and limited data, an analysis focusing on each swing state will likely yeild more substantitve takewaways. In this section, I will consider the win margins for 5 key states, based on the NYT, and what this means, based on the polls in these states 27 days from the election

make a table of 5 contains all 5 states. 

then mini takeaways at bottom, bulleted, like this

* **Florida.**  The win margin for florida is X. This is based on the polls in such state, which currently stand at X for Biden and Y for Trump. This would mean Biden would carry all the electoral votes from this state. 

* **Ohio.**  The win margin for ohio is X. This is based on the polls in such state, which currently stand at X for Biden and Y for Trump. This would mean Biden would carry all the electoral votes from this state. 

This tells us that, in the most important states, Biden has the clear advantage. Basesd on our probabalistc models, Biden stands a good chance of carriyng X of the Y total electoral votes. This is significnat, as a decisisve win in the swing states gives Biden a significantly higher chance of winning the eleciton. This is in stark contrast to 2016, which, as blog 1 demonstrated, had trump dispoportionalty take the electoral votes in the swing states, and led him to victory. 

**Final Takeaways**

In this blog, we used probabalistic models to evaaltue the electoral prospects for the 2020 candidates. An analysis of the swing states affirms earlier blog's favoring biden using linear regression models, as biden seems like he will take the swing states, and thus stands a pole positon for the elections. OF course, polls are not the only metric for evalauting candidate, but based on my findings in previous blogs, stands as a good indicator for the upcoming election.
