# Post-Election Reflection 
## November 17, 2020

Intro lines before this. 
In this blog, I will seek to provide a comprehensive reflection on my final prediction model. I will do this by first recapping such model and its main predictions. Then, I will touch on its inaccuracies, specifically highlighting the trends I found in such. Given such inaccuracies, I will propose two main hypotheses for why the model was inaccurate at times and propose quantitative tests that could test the validity of these hypotheses. Ultimatley, I will end by touching on how I might change my model if I were to do it again.
