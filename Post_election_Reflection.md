# Post-Election Reflection 
## November 17, 2020

Intro lines before this. 
In this blog, I will seek to provide a comprehensive reflection on my final prediction model. I will do this by first recapping such model and its main predictions. Then, I will touch on its inaccuracies, specifically highlighting the trends I found in such. Given such inaccuracies, I will propose two main hypotheses for why the model was inaccurate at times and propose quantitative tests that could test the validity of these hypotheses. Ultimatley, I will end by touching on how I might change my model if I were to do it again. 

**The Average Suppot Model and its Predictions**

My model, the average support model, consists of a linear regression between the the popular vote share and average support for Democratic or Republican presidential candidates. The regression for the Democratic and Republican candidate average support models is based on national popular vote and average poll support data for presidential election candidates from 1968 to 2016. The formulas for each party's average support model are listed below: 

Democrat average support model: predicted popular vote share = 23.4186 + 0.5286 (average support)

Republican average support model: predicted popular vote share = 12.5561 + 0.7829 (average support)

I used such models the derive the national pv2p for both canddiates, as well as their state by state pv2p, based on national and state-level average support data, respectivley. 

Model Predictions here. 


should I justify application to state? probs not, will roast it and mention it later on in hypothesis 1 (in my predictions, I assumed model could be applied to each state.....but did not account for bias...)


quick recap, so maybe 150-200 words max?
just provide model, variables, national model applied to states, then list of states I predicted blue and red (would be nice to include map of this, but not necessary), electoral vote and national pv2p.
